<h1>Big O notation - Time Complexity </h1>
-O(1) 
no for loop or anything just easy transactions
Def foo:   
return 1 + 2
<br>
-O(n)
One for loop
For I in range
<br>
-O(n^2)Two for loops one being nested
For I in range
    for x in range
if it is 
For I in range
    for x in range
<br>
For I in range 
<br>
This is O(n^2) you keep the slowest running speed
