<h1>Big O notation - Time Complexity </h1>
-O(1) <br>
no for loop or anything just easy transactions<br>
Def foo:   <br>
return 1 + 2<br>
<br>
-O(n)<br>
One for loop<br>
For I in range<br>
<br>
-O(n^2)Two for loops one being nested<br>
For I in range<br>
<tb>    for x in range<br>
if it is <br>
For I in range<br>
  <tb>  for x in range
<br>
For I in range <br>
<br>
This is O(n^2) you keep the slowest running speed
