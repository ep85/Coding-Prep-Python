<h1>Big O notation - Time Complexity </h1>
<h2>O(1)</h2>
<p>no for loop or anything just easy transactions</p>
<code>
```
Def foo:
    return 1 + 2
```
</code>
<h2>O(n)</h2>
One for loop<br>
For I in range<br>
<h2>-O(n^2)</h2>
Two for loops one being nested<br>
For I in range<br>
    for x in range<br>
if it is <br>
For I in range<br>
    for x in range
For I in range 
This is O(n^2) you keep the slowest running speed
