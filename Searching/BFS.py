BFS stands for Breadth First Search is a vertex based technique for finding a shortest path
 in graph. It uses a Queue data structure which follows first in first out. In BFS, one 
 vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent are visited 
 and stored in the queue. It is slower than DFS.
