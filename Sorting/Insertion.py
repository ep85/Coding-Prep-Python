Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and 
placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Algorithm 
To sort an array of size n in ascending order: 
1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. 
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. 
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. 
   Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

Big O
Best Î©(n)		
Average Î˜(n^2)	
Worst O(n^2)

Space Complexity
O(1)


Example: 
12, 11, 13, 5, 6
Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 4 (last element of the array)
i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12 
11, 12, 13, 5, 6
i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements in A[0..I-1] are smaller than 13 
11, 12, 13, 5, 6
i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position. 
5, 11, 12, 13, 6
i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position. 
5, 6, 11, 12, 13

# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort
# Function to do insertion sort
def insertionSort(arr):
 
    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
 
        key = arr[i]
 
        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
        # greater than key, to one position ahead
        # of their current position
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j] :
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
 
 
# Driver code to test above
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]

for i in range(len(arr)):
    print ("% d" % arr[i])
